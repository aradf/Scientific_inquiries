Some comments

With OpenCV function cv2.findContours() we find 
contours of white object from black background.

There are three arguments in cv.findContours() function,
first one is source image, second is contour retrieval mode,
third is contour approximation method.


In OpenCV version 3 three parameters are returned:
modified image, the contours and hierarchy.
Further reading about Contours in OpenCV v3:
https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/d73/tutorial_py_contours_begin.html


In OpenCV version 4 two parameters are returned:
the contours and hierarchy.
Further reading about Contours in OpenCV v4:
https://docs.opencv.org/4.0.0/d4/d73/tutorial_py_contours_begin.html


Contours is a Python list of all the contours in the image.
Each individual contour is a Numpy array of (x,y) coordinates 
of boundary points of the object.

Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the 
continuous points (along the boundary), having same colour or intensity.
